Run script/wardrobe_server.pl to test the application.

== Notes ==

The database is SQLite for ease of portability.

No tests were written or much documentation due to time pressure.

Also, I should have moved some of the code from the controller into the models (thin client/fat model and all...) but I couldn't figure out how to call the model method in time.

I probably also should not have used the Root controller so heavily.

I also didn't manage to find time to add the outfit functionality :(!

Oh and _nothing_ is validated, which obviously it should be.

Thanks,
Adam
